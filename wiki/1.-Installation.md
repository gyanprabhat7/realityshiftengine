### 1. Setup your platform

- [Linux](https://github.com/s0md3v/roop/wiki/1.1-Setup-Linux)
- [MacOS](https://github.com/s0md3v/roop/wiki/1.2-Setup-MacOS)
- [Windows](https://github.com/s0md3v/roop/wiki/1.3-Setup-Windows)

### 2. Clone Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/gyanprabhat7/realityshiftengine
```

### 3. Install dependencies

We highly recommend to work with a venv or conda to avoid issues.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Done

You should be able to run roop using `python run.py` command. Keep in mind that while running the program for first time, it will download some models which can take time depending on your network connection.
